## My Projects 

**Healthcare Decision Support System

I meticulously corrected data errors, structured data for analysis, and uncovered insights for medical decision-making. Using advanced statistics, I translated findings into actionable reports for healthcare professionals. 

I employed bootstrapping to diversify data for model training, enhancing generalization. Leveraging the Perceptron algorithm, I optimized decision boundaries for effective class separation. Feature selection via Recursive Feature Elimination improved model accuracy and interpretability. 

This process ensured a robust healthcare decision support system delivering precise insights for enhanced patient care.

**Cryptocurrency - Finance And Banking Analysis
Through this project, I mastered data analysis with Pandas in Python, focusing on cryptocurrencies and gaining skills applicable to finance and banking.

I explored Pandas Series and DataFrame fundamentals, covering indexing, sorting, selection, and manipulation. Advanced operations included filtering, cleaning, merging, encoding, scaling, slicing, concatenating, and multi-indexing. I also handled data exploration, group-by functionalities, date/time data, and text processing.

Additionally, I developed advanced data visualization techniques to create graphical representations of trends and insights.
